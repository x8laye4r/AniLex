# AniLex – Your Personal Anime Tracker
First of all, I want to say it's **UNOFFICIAL** and not supported by **AniList**!

_**AniLex**_ is a native desktop app to manage your Anime, Manga, and Light Novel lists using the AniList GraphQL API.  
It's designed specifically for Windows/Linux users who want a clean, modern interface – no outdated UI, no web wrappers, no bloat.

> ⚠️ **Important:** This project is still **in active development**.  
> It's my **first major project in C++** and also my **very first desktop app**. I'm learning as I go, feedback is welcome!

> 🧪 **Note:** Currently only tested on **Linux**.  <br>
> **Windows** will be tested later, but support is be planned. <br>
> **macOS** might never come — I simply have no system to test it on.

> 💬 *Disclaimer:*  
> This is my **first major C++ project** and also my **first desktop app**.  
> Things might break, explode, or summon undefined behavior while developing it until everything works as intended

## 💡 Why AniLex?

I noticed that most AniList-based trackers either:
- Look outdated, especially on Windows (don't get me wrong they have cool features)
- Are web-only add-ons for Firefox or Chrome
- Lack a clean, intuitive UI

AniLex aims to fix that by being:
- 🪶 A native Windows/Linux app (no Electron, no browser)
- 🧼 Clean and modern UI look
- ⚙️ Highly customizable
- 🎨 Built for users who like to tweak their setup, but also who want something out of the box
- 🧩 Planned will be a Plugin System, but I don't know if I get that to work in C++

## 📛 Naming

As a German programming student, I took inspiration from the word **"Lexikon"** (meaning encyclopedia or dictionary).  
Combining that with **"Ani"** for anime, I came up with **AniLex** – a name that reflects both structure and focus: an organized place for all your anime data.

AniLex is a personal learning project, but I'm always happy if someone wants to contribute!

If you're interested in helping out – whether it's writing better code, improving the UI, suggesting features, or just fixing typos – feel free to open issues or send pull requests.

I'm still learning, so please be patient if I ask questions or need a bit of help understanding your code 😄

Any contribution, no matter how small, is welcome!

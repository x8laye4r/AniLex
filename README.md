# AniLex – Your Personal Anime Tracker
First of all, I want to say it's **UNOFFICIAL** and not supported by **AniList**!

_**AniLex**_ is a native desktop app to manage your Anime, Manga, and Light Novel lists using the AniList API.  
It’s designed specifically for Windows users (for now) who want a clean, modern interface – no outdated UI, no web wrappers, no bloat.

> ⚠️ **Important:** This project is still **in active development**.  
> It's my **first major project in Python** and also my **very first desktop app**. I'm learning as I go, feedback is welcome!

> 🧪 **Note:** Currently only tested on **Windows**.  
> **Linux support is planned** once the core functionality is finished.

> ❗**Consider:** As you already know this is my first ever project for an app and I'm still learning how to make an app and programm with python. So be prepared to see a lot of shit happening while I'm coding this.

## 💡 Why AniLex?

I noticed that most AniList-based trackers either:
- Look outdated, especially on Windows
- Are web-only add-ons for Firefox or Chrome
- Lack a clean, intuitive UI

**AniLex** aims to fix that by being:
- Native
- Lightweight (if I can get it to work)
- Focused on clean UI
- Built for native desktop use and no browser add-ons

## 🔧 Features (planned / in progress)

- 🖼 GUI built with PySide6 (Qt for Python)
- 🔍 Search for Anime, Manga & Light Novels via AniList GraphQL API
- 🗂 Support for tracking progress and watchlists
- 📄 Detailed info: descriptions, covers, status, episodes/chapters, ratings
- 🧩 Support for multiple media types (Animes and Mangas)
- 🤖 OpenAI support for custom Anime/Manga recomendations

## 📛 Naming

As a German programming student, I took inspiration from the word **"Lexikon"** (meaning encyclopedia or dictionary).  
Combining that with **"Ani"** for anime, I came up with **AniLex** – a name that reflects both structure and focus: an organized place for all your anime data.

## 🤝 Contributing

AniLex is a personal learning project, but I'm always happy if someone wants to contribute!

If you're interested in helping out – whether it's writing better code, improving the UI, suggesting features, or just fixing typos – feel free to open issues or send pull requests.

I'm still learning, so please be patient if I ask questions or need a bit of help understanding your code 😄

Any contribution, no matter how small, is welcome!
